# JellyBeans
Looking at a random photo of jelly beans, is it possible to determine what percent of the picture is made up of yellow beans? The short answer is yes, it is possible using the PIL module in python. The PIL module is the package that is responsible for the majority of image processing within python as it is a diverse package with multiple functions. In this code specifically, I first had to import the image, and set variables that would go through every pixel available in the photo. By setting the variables, width and height, and initializing a value to zero, I would be able to go through each individual pixel, evaluate the colour, and add it to its individual colour counter. Using RGB values, and defining the colour spectrum that yellow falls under, I was able to use a nested for loop to sort through pixels. Once I determined the total number of yellow pixels, I divided it by the resolution of the image (width times height) and multiply it by 100 to determine that around 17% of the photo is comprised of yellow jelly beans.
